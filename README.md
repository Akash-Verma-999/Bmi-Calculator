BMI Categories:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: BMI 18.5 - 24.9
Overweight: BMI 25 - 29.9
Obese: BMI â‰¥ 30
Why is BMI Important?
BMI helps in identifying potential health risks related to weight, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity-related conditions. However, it does not account for muscle mass, bone density, or fat distribution, so it should be used as a general guideline rather than a definitive health measure.
