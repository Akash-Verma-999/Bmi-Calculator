Body Mass Index (BMI)
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value calculated from a person's weight and height. It is widely used to categorize individuals into different weight categories and assess potential health risks. The formula for BMI is:

𝐵
𝑀
𝐼
=
weight (kg)
height (m)
2
BMI= 
height (m) 
2
 
weight (kg)
​
 
BMI Categories:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: BMI 18.5 - 24.9
Overweight: BMI 25 - 29.9
Obese: BMI ≥ 30
Why is BMI Important?
BMI helps in identifying potential health risks related to weight, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity-related conditions. However, it does not account for muscle mass, bone density, or fat distribution, so it should be used as a general guideline rather than a definitive health measure.
